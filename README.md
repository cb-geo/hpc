High Performance Computing
==========================

The University of Cambridge offers High Performance Computing (HPC) facility for research. The HPCS offers a CPU compute cluster (Darwin) and a GPU compute cluster (Wilkes), both located at the West Cambridge Data Centre.

To access the HPCS facility, a secure connection is required between your machine (laptops, desktops) and the HPC facility. This documentation covers step-by-step instructions on how to connect, run jobs and transfer files on the HPCS facility.

> **Note** Detailed instructions on using the HPC can be found on the [HPC site](http://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/using-clusters/) and on [an introduction to HPC course](http://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/getting-help/introtohpc-course).
