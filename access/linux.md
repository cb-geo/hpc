## Linux or Mac OS 

Launch a terminal on Linux or Mac OS and connect to HPCS using SSH: `ssh ab123@login.hpc.cam.ac.uk`, where ab123 is your CRSid. More information on connecting to HPCS using SSH can be found [here](http://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/using-clusters/connecting). If `SSH` is not installed, you might have to download and compile `OpenSSH`.
