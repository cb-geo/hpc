# Accessing the HPC Service

The Cambridge HPCS can be accessed directly via the Cambridge University Data Network (which includes Departments, Colleges and University facilities). See Off-site access if you wish to access HPC services outside of the University Data Network. 

All users should access Darwin or Wilkes initially through the login nodes. There are eight individual login nodes `login-sand1` to `login-sand8`. In addition nodes `login-gfx1` also has NVIDIA graphics cards and can be used for remote visualisation.

> **Warning** Never run any computationally intensive or long-duration applications on login nodes, use computational nodes instead. Only use login nodes to compile, run small test-cases and visualise results.


# Secure Shell (SSH)

SSH, is an encrypted network protocol that allows remote login and other network services. The following section describes how to establish a SSH connection with the HPCS.
