### Service Levels

The service allows a range of service levels with different features.

There are 4 service levels 

* `SL1` Guaranteed Usage

* `SL2` Ad Hoc Usage

* `SL3` Free Usage

* `SL4` Residual Usage

Service levels 2 to 4 apply to our research group. The [costs section](cost.md) applies to `SL2` usage. Every Cambridge researcher gets free usage on `SL4` in [`QOS3` level](qos.md). As a research group, who pays for `SL2` usage, we get 200,000 core hours for free on `SL3`. You are encouraged to use `SL3` before using `SL2`, whenever possible.

Further information on these different service levels is available [here](http://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/policies/service-levels)
